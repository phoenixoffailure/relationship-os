**Result**: All API calls now save data properly, relationship scoring working

## ✅ RESOLVED - Phase 8.1 Issues (All Complete)

### Issue #1: Memory System User ID Bug ✅ RESOLVED
**Status**: ✅ Complete - User ID now properly passed to memory system
**Solution**: Added userId parameter to tryMemoryBasedInsights function and all calling locations

## 🔧 CURRENT - Phase 8.2 Issues (New Optimization Phase)

### Issue #1: Multiple Insights Generated Per Trigger ⚠️ NEW
**Status**: ⚠️ Enhancement Needed - Currently generates 4 insights every time
**Problem**: Users get overwhelmed with multiple insights, increases API costs
**Goal**: Generate 1 comprehensive insight covering all relevant aspects
**Priority**: High (cost optimization and user experience)

### Issue #2: No Triggering Conditions ⚠️ NEW  
**Status**: ⚠️ Logic Needed - Insights generate on every API call
**Problem**: No checks for new content, can spam users with repeated insights
**Goal**: Only generate when new journal entry + daily checkin exist
**Priority**: High (prevents spam, ensures fresh insights)

### Issue #3: Partner Suggestions Not Optimized ⚠️ NEW
**Status**: ⚠️ Batch Processing - Currently generates multiple suggestions
**Problem**: Daily batch creates multiple partner suggestions per relationship
**Goal**: Generate 1 comprehensive suggestion distilling all important points
**Priority**: Medium (cost optimization)
