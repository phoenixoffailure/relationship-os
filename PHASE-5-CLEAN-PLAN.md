# Phase 5: Clean Multi-Relationship Dashboard Plan 🎯

**Goal**: Transform overwhelming single-relationship dashboard → Clean, multi-relationship management with **only recent unread insights**

---

## 🧹 SIMPLIFIED DASHBOARD APPROACH

### **The Problem with Current Dashboard**:
- **Overwhelming**: Too many insights, tabs, components on screen at once
- **Cluttered**: Old insights pile up and create noise  
- **Hard to Focus**: Can't quickly see what actually needs attention
- **Single Relationship**: Only shows one relationship at a time

### **New Clean Philosophy**:
- **Recent Only**: Show only the most recent insights (last 24-48 hours)
- **Unread Focus**: Once marked as read, insights disappear from dashboard
- **Glanceable**: Quick overview across all relationships  
- **Action-Oriented**: What needs attention right now?

## 🎯 CLEAN DASHBOARD ARCHITECTURE

### **New Simplified Structure**:
```
Clean Multi-Relationship Dashboard
├── TOP: Swipeable Relationship Cards (Health + Recent Activity)
│   ├── [💕 Sarah] Health: 85 📈 • 1 new insight
│   ├── [👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Mom] Health: 72 ➡️ • 2 new suggestions  
│   └── [👥 Mike] Health: 68 📉 • Needs attention
│
├── MIDDLE: Recent Unread Insights (Clean List)
│   ├── 💕 Sarah: "Consider planning quality time after work stress"
│   ├── 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Mom: "She mentioned feeling disconnected lately"
│   └── [Mark as Read] [View Details] buttons per insight
│
├── BOTTOM: Quick Actions for Selected Relationship
│   └── Context-aware actions based on selected card
│
└── FOOTER: "View All Insights" link (goes to separate insights page)
```

### **Key Clean Design Principles**:
1. **Less is More**: Only show what needs immediate attention
2. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Cards → Insights → Actions flow
3. **Read/Unread States**: Clear insights after user reads them
4. **Mobile-First**: Clean, scrollable, touch-friendly
5. **Relationship Context**: Easy switching without overwhelming detail

## 📱 CLEAN UI COMPONENTS DESIGN

### **Relationship Cards (Simplified)**:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 💕 Sarah (Romantic)     │ ← Type icon + name + type
│ ● 85/100 📈            │ ← Health score + trend  
│ 1 new insight          │ ← Unread count only
│ Active 2h ago          │ ← Last activity
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### **Clean Insights List**:
```
💕 Consider planning quality time this weekend
   ◦ Mark as Read  ◦ View Details        [2h ago]

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Mom mentioned feeling isolated in last call
   ◦ Mark as Read  ◦ Call Mom            [1d ago]

💼 Team morale seems low after project setback  
   ◦ Mark as Read  ◦ Schedule Check-in   [3h ago]
```

### **Read State Management**:
- **Unread**: Show on dashboard with clear "Mark as Read" action
- **Read**: Remove from dashboard completely (still accessible in /insights page)
- **Acknowledged**: Optional middle state for "seen but not acted on"

---

## 🗂️ INSIGHT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### **Database Schema Addition**:
```sql
-- Add read/unread state to insights
ALTER TABLE relationship_insights 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS read_status TEXT DEFAULT 'unread' 
CHECK (read_status IN ('unread', 'read', 'acknowledged'));

ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS read_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS dashboard_dismissed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Same for partner suggestions  
ALTER TABLE partner_suggestions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS read_status TEXT DEFAULT 'unread'
CHECK (read_status IN ('unread', 'read', 'acknowledged'));

ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS read_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS dashboard_dismissed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Index for fast unread queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_insights_unread 
ON relationship_insights (generated_for_user, read_status, created_at DESC)
WHERE read_status = 'unread' AND dashboard_dismissed = FALSE;
```

### **Dashboard Insight Rules**:
1. **Show Recent Unread Only**: Last 48 hours, unread status, not dismissed
2. **Limit Per Relationship**: Max 2-3 insights per relationship on dashboard
3. **Priority Ordering**: High priority insights first, then by recency
4. **Auto-Dismiss**: Insights older than 7 days auto-marked as read
5. **Manual Control**: User can "Mark as Read" or "Dismiss from Dashboard"

## 🎨 CLEAN DASHBOARD IMPLEMENTATION

### **Phase 5.1: Relationship Cards (Simplified)**
**File**: `components/dashboard/clean-relationship-cards.tsx`

```typescript
interface CleanRelationshipCard {
  id: string
  name: string
  type: 'romantic' | 'family' | 'friend' | 'work'
  health_score: number
  trend: 'improving' | 'stable' | 'declining'
  unread_insights: number
  last_activity: string
  needs_attention: boolean
}
```

**Features**:
- Clean card design with essential info only
- Health score (large, prominent)  
- Unread count (red badge if > 0)
- Last activity timestamp
- Swipeable/scrollable horizontal layout

### **Phase 5.2: Clean Insights Feed**
**File**: `components/dashboard/clean-insights-feed.tsx`

```typescript
interface CleanInsight {
  id: string
  relationship_id: string
  relationship_name: string
  relationship_type: string
  insight_text: string
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  created_at: string
  suggested_actions: string[]
  read_status: 'unread' | 'read' | 'acknowledged'
}
```

**Features**:
- Show only unread insights from last 48 hours
- One-click "Mark as Read" (removes from dashboard)
- Suggested quick actions per insight
- Relationship context (icon + name)
- Clean typography, lots of white space

### **Phase 5.3: Read State Management**
**File**: `lib/services/insight-state-manager.ts`

**Features**:
- `markInsightAsRead(insightId)` → removes from dashboard
- `dismissFromDashboard(insightId)` → hide without marking read
- `getUnreadDashboardInsights(userId)` → recent unread only
- Auto-cleanup of old insights
- Batch operations for multiple insights

### **Phase 5.4: Clean Dashboard Page**
**Modify**: `app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Replace complex enhanced dashboard with clean cards
- Show relationship cards at top (swipeable)
- Show clean insights list in middle (unread only)
- Context-aware quick actions at bottom
- "View All Insights" link to full insights page

## 🧠 INSIGHT GENERATION ADJUSTMENTS

### **Maintain Current AI Tone** (From Phase 3):
- **Keep Warm Professional Therapist Tone**: The current balance is perfect
- **No Clinical Language**: Avoid "Your metrics indicate..." or "Analysis suggests..."
- **No Pet Names**: No "darling", "sweetheart", etc.
- **Current Working Tone**: "I notice how physical intimacy is helping you rediscover your connection"

### **Smart 4-Pillar Selection Framework**:

#### **The 4 Pillars (Insight Types)**:
1. **🔍 Pattern Recognition**: "I notice you tend to..." (behavioral patterns, cycles)
2. **🌱 Growth Suggestions**: "Consider trying..." (actionable next steps)
3. **❤️ Appreciation/Context**: "It's meaningful that..." (reframe, validate)
4. **🎉 Milestone Celebrations**: "You've achieved..." (progress acknowledgment)

#### **Intelligent Selection Logic**:
- **Analyze Each Journal**: Evaluate relevance of each pillar type (0-100 score)
- **Select Top 1-2**: Only generate insights for pillars with >70 relevance
- **Use Full Psychology Data**: FIRO needs, attachment style, communication preferences inform ALL pillars
- **Context-Aware**: Relationship type (romantic/family/friend/work) shapes the insight

#### **Example Consolidation**:
```
Journal: "We had another argument about chores. I just shut down again."

AI Analysis:
- Pattern Score: 95 (repetitive shutdown behavior detected)
- Growth Score: 85 (clear action opportunity)
- Appreciation Score: 30 (not relevant here)
- Milestone Score: 10 (no achievement)

Generated Insights (Top 2):
1. Pattern: "I notice when household tasks become a control issue, you tend to shut down rather than express your needs directly."
2. Growth: "Consider using your assertive communication style to suggest a household planning session - this could meet your need for structure while preventing shutdown cycles."
```

### **Batch Processing Enhancement**:
**Modify**: `app/api/batch/daily-partner-suggestions/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Set insights to `unread` status by default
- Add priority scoring for dashboard relevance
- Limit insights per relationship per day (max 2-3)
- Better deduplication to avoid repetitive insights

### **Personal Insights API Update**:
**Modify**: `app/api/insights/generate/route.ts`

**Changes**:  
- Implement 4-pillar relevance scoring (pattern/growth/appreciation/milestone)
- Generate only top 1-2 most relevant pillars per journal
- Set default read_status as 'unread'
- Add pillar_type field to track which insight type
- Maintain current warm professional therapist tone (no changes to tone)
- Use full psychological profile (FIRO, attachment, communication) to inform all pillars

## 📊 CLEAN DASHBOARD DATA FLOW

### **Dashboard Load Process**:
1. **Fetch All User Relationships** → Get basic info + health scores
2. **Count Unread Insights Per Relationship** → Show red badges
3. **Get Recent Unread Insights** → Last 48hrs, priority ordered, max 5-7 total
4. **Render Clean Interface** → Cards + insights + actions

### **User Interactions**:
1. **Swipe/Click Relationship Card** → Update selected relationship + quick actions
2. **Mark Insight as Read** → Remove from dashboard immediately  
3. **View Details** → Expand insight or navigate to insights page
4. **Quick Action** → Execute action + mark related insight as acknowledged

### **Background Cleanup**:
- **Daily**: Auto-mark insights >7 days as read
- **Weekly**: Archive old insights to prevent database bloat
- **On Load**: Remove dismissed insights from dashboard queries
