## üîß Technical Details

### Database Tables Needing Types (Priority)
1. `universal_user_profiles` - Critical for AI
2. `relationship_profiles` - Critical for context
3. `enhanced_journal_analysis` - For journal system
4. `ai_memory_entries` - For memory system
5. `ai_conversation_history` - For context
6. Plus 45+ other tables

### Files That Will Be Affected
- All files in `/app/api/*` - API routes
- Components using database queries
- Utility functions accessing database

## üí° Important Notes

- **DO NOT** create new tables - they all exist
- **DO NOT** modify schema - it's complete
- **FOCUS ON** connecting existing pieces
- **VERIFY** against `database/rolling-supabase-schema`

## üöÄ Quick Status for New Session

**Where We Are**: 
- **Phase 8.3: COMPLETE** - All database integration and payment system operational
- **Phase 9: IN PROGRESS** - Final Launch Rules Implementation

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ Database: 41 tables fully typed and secured
- ‚úÖ AI System: Memory-enhanced with Grok API integration  
- ‚úÖ Payment: Full Stripe integration with flexible feature gating
- ‚úÖ Premium: 21 features configured across 2 pricing tiers
- ‚úÖ Security: Comprehensive RLS policies and webhook verification
- ‚úÖ Documentation: Complete architecture and payment system guides

**Phase 9 Requirements (CRITICAL FOR LAUNCH)**:
1. **Check-ins**: Limit to 1 per relationship per day (ALL users)
2. **Free Tier Insights**: 1 per day AFTER check-in, first journal only
3. **Premium Insights**: Every journal after check-in generates insight
4. **Partner Suggestions**: Premium-only, 1 per relationship batched daily
5. **Relationship Limit**: Free users capped at 5 relationships

**Implementation Plan**:
- Step 1: Create `generation_controls` table for tracking limits
- Step 2: Enforce check-in limitation (1 per day per relationship)
- Step 3: Gate insights behind check-in requirement
- Step 4: Differentiate free vs premium insight generation
- Step 5: Make partner suggestions premium-only
- Step 6: Update UI/UX with new restrictions and CTAs

**Breaking Changes**:
- Users can no longer check in multiple times per day
- Free users lose partner suggestions feature
- All insights now require check-in first

### Session 8: Phase 9 - Final Launch Rules Implementation
**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Session Goal**: Implement business-critical rules from Reassessment-needs.md for sustainable launch

**What We're Implementing**:
1. ‚è≥ Database infrastructure - `generation_controls` table for limit tracking
2. ‚è≥ Check-in enforcement - Limit to 1 per relationship per day
3. ‚è≥ Insight gating - Require check-in before any insights
4. ‚è≥ Tier differentiation - Free: 1 insight/day, Premium: unlimited after check-in
5. ‚è≥ Partner suggestions - Make premium-only (remove from free tier)
6. ‚è≥ UI/UX updates - Add restrictions, upgrade CTAs, status indicators

**Implementation Steps Completed**:
- [x] Updated BUILD.md with Phase 9 requirements and tasks
- [x] Created detailed implementation plan with timeline
- [x] Created generation_controls table schema with helper functions
  - Added `phase-9-generation-controls.sql` migration file
  - Includes RLS policies and performance indexes
  - Helper functions: `can_user_checkin()`, `can_generate_insight()`, `record_checkin()`, `record_insight_generation()`
- [x] Generated TypeScript types for generation_controls
  - Added to `lib/types/database.generated.ts`
  - Includes Row, Insert, and Update types
  - Properly integrated with existing Database type structure
- [x] Implemented check-in limitation logic
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Discovered /checkin page uses RelationshipCheckin.tsx, not checkin-form.tsx
  - Fixed corrupted syntax in checkin-form.tsx (malformed opening characters)
  - Added complete Phase 9 logic to RelationshipCheckin.tsx (actual component being used)
  - Implemented database function validation with `can_user_checkin()` and `record_checkin()`
  - Added visual status indicators: green "checked in" vs blue "ready" banners
  - Shows check-in status in relationship selector dropdown
  - Disables submit button with clear messaging when already checked in
  - Fixed column name mismatch: `status` -> `subscription_status` across all components
- [x] Modified insight generation with check-in requirement and tier logic
  - Updated `app/api/journal/save-and-analyze/route.ts` with check-in validation
  - Uses `can_generate_insight()` function to check eligibility
  - Free tier: Only first journal after check-in generates insight
  - Premium tier: Every journal after check-in generates insight
  - Records insight generation with `record_insight_generation()` function
  - Added contextual messaging for denial reasons
  - Fixed database constraint to include 'comprehensive' insight type
- [x] Made partner suggestions premium-only
  - Updated `lib/paywall/config.ts`: Set partner_suggestions_limited to premium: true
  - Updated `FREE_TIER_LIMITS.partner_suggestions_per_day` to 0
  - Modified `app/api/batch/daily-partner-suggestions/route.ts` to filter premium users only
  - Updated `components/dashboard/PartnerSuggestions.tsx` with premium gate UI
  - Shows attractive locked tile with upgrade CTA for free users
- [x] Added comprehensive UI/UX restrictions and CTAs
  - Updated `components/journal/CleanJournalLayout.tsx` with check-in status indicators
  - Added premium status and eligibility messaging in journal composer
  - Visual check-in indicators on relationship tabs
  - Updated `app/premium/pricing/page.tsx` with new rules and feature descriptions
  - Contextual messaging for insight eligibility based on check-in and tier status
- [x] Implemented comprehensive analytics tracking
  - Created `lib/analytics/events.ts` with all required event types
  - Tracks journal submissions, check-in completions, and insight generations
  - Tracks insight denials (no_checkin, free_tier_limit) with proper context
  - Tracks paywall interactions and conversion attempts
  - Added tracking to check-in form, journal components, and partner suggestions
  - Events stored in localStorage for development testing

**PHASE 9 FINAL VERIFICATION**:
- [x] Check-in limitations working: 1 per relationship per day enforced
- [x] Visual UI indicators showing check-in status clearly
- [x] Insight generation requires check-in completion
- [x] Free tier: 1 insight per day after check-in
- [x] Premium tier: unlimited insights after check-in
- [x] Partner suggestions premium-only
- [x] All database functions operational
- [x] All business rules from Reassessment-needs.md implemented

**Critical Files Being Modified**:
1. `database/latest-rolling-supabase-schema` - Adding generation_controls table
2. `components/checkin/checkin-form.tsx` - Check-in limitation

4. `app/api/insights/generate/route.ts` - Tier-specific generation
5. `lib/paywall/config.ts` - Updated free tier limits
6. `app/api/batch/daily-partner-suggestions/route.ts` - Premium filter

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Feature flag rollout to test with subset of users
- 7-day notice period for existing users
- Monitoring conversion and churn metrics closely

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 40% additional API cost reduction
- 15% increase in free-to-premium conversion
- Improved daily active user engagement through check-in habit
