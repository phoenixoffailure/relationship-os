# RESEARCH.md - Psychological Foundation

## ðŸ§  Overview

RelationshipOS is built on peer-reviewed psychological research. Every feature must be backed by at least 3 studies with clear citations.

## ðŸ“š Core Theories

### FIRO Theory (Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation)
**Developer**: William Schutz (1958)
**Validation**: 50+ years of research, thousands of studies

#### Three Fundamental Needs
1. **Inclusion** (Social connection need)
   - Scale: 1-9 (low to high need)
   - Impacts: How much user seeks social interaction
   - AI Application: Adjusts suggestion frequency and social emphasis

2. **Control** (Influence and structure need)
   - Scale: 1-9 (low to high need)  
   - Impacts: Preference for agency vs guidance
   - AI Application: Balance between prescriptive and exploratory suggestions

3. **Affection** (Emotional closeness need)
   - Scale: 1-9 (low to high need)
   - Impacts: Comfort with intimacy and warmth
   - AI Application: Emotional intensity of language and suggestions

#### Implementation
```typescript
// Example user profile:
{
  inclusion_need: 8,  // High need for connection
  control_need: 7,    // Moderate-high need for influence
  affection_need: 8   // High need for closeness
}
```

### Attachment Theory
**Developers**: Bowlby & Ainsworth (1960s-1980s)
**Validation**: Extensive research across cultures and ages

#### Four Attachment Styles

1. **Secure Attachment** (~60% of population)
   - Comfortable with intimacy and independence
   - AI Response: Direct, confident, balanced suggestions
   - Research: Hazan & Shaver (1987), Mikulincer & Shaver (2007)

2. **Anxious Attachment** (~20% of population)
   - Craves closeness, fears abandonment
   - AI Response: Extra reassurance, validation, consistency
   - Research: Brennan et al. (1998), Wei et al. (2007)

3. **Avoidant Attachment** (~15% of population)
   - Values independence, uncomfortable with closeness
   - AI Response: Respect boundaries, gradual intimacy building
   - Research: Fraley & Shaver (2000), Joel et al. (2011)

4. **Disorganized Attachment** (~5% of population)
   - Inconsistent patterns, internal conflict
   - AI Response: Gentle, non-judgmental, flexible approach
   - Research: Main & Solomon (1986), Paetzold et al. (2015)

### Communication Styles Theory
**Foundation**: Multiple theories integrated

#### Directness Dimension
- **Direct**: Clear, straightforward communication
- **Indirect**: Diplomatic, contextual communication
- Research: Hall (1976) - High/Low Context Cultures

#### Assertiveness Dimension  
- **Assertive**: Confident expression of needs
- **Passive**: Avoids confrontation
- **Aggressive**: Forceful, dominating
- Research: Alberti & Emmons (1974)

#### Conflict Styles (Thomas-Kilmann)
- **Competing**: Win-lose approach
- **Collaborating**: Win-win seeking
- **Compromising**: Middle ground
- **Avoiding**: Conflict avoidance
- **Accommodating**: Other-focused
- Research: Thomas & Kilmann (1974)
