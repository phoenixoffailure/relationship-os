## Gating Implementation Details

### 1. Check-in Requirement System âœ…

#### Implementation: `generation_controls` table
```sql
-- Tracks daily check-in status
last_checkin_at timestamptz
checkin_date date  
checkins_today integer DEFAULT 0  -- Always 0 or 1
```

#### Business Logic
- **Hard Limit**: 1 check-in per relationship per day
- **UI Behavior**: Check-in button disabled after completion
- **Status Display**: "âœ“ Checked in today" badge shown
- **Insight Gate**: No insights generate without check-in completion

#### User Experience Flow
1. User visits relationship â†’ Check-in button prominent
2. Complete check-in â†’ Button disabled, success state shown
3. Journal entry â†’ AI insight generated (if eligible)
4. Next day â†’ Check-in resets, process repeats

### 2. Insight Generation Gating âœ…

#### Free Tier Logic (Implemented)
```typescript
// Phase 9: Free users get 1 insight per day
if (!isPremium && user.first_journal_after_checkin_today) {
  return "Daily insight limit reached. Upgrade for unlimited insights."
}

// Must check in first
if (!user.checkin_date_today) {
  return "Complete your daily check-in to unlock insights."
}
```

#### Premium Tier Logic (Implemented)
```typescript
// Premium users: unlimited insights after check-in
if (isPremium && user.checkin_date_today) {
  return generateInsight() // No limits
}
```

#### Conversion Trigger Points
- **First Limit Hit**: "You've reached your daily insight limit"
- **Upgrade CTA**: "Upgrade to Premium for unlimited insights"
- **Value Demonstration**: Show preview of additional insights available

### 3. Partner Suggestions Premium Gate âœ…

#### Complete Removal from Free Tier

// lib/paywall/config.ts
export const FREE_TIER_LIMITS = {
  partner_suggestions_per_day: 0, // Phase 9: Premium-only
}
```

## Conversion Psychology & UX

### Strategic Friction Points

#### 1. Daily Insight Limit (Primary Driver)
**Trigger**: After user's first insight of the day
**Message**: "You've unlocked your daily insight! Premium users get unlimited insights."
**CTA**: "Upgrade for $15/month"
**Psychology**: Creates FOMO after demonstrating value

#### 2. Partner Suggestions Tease (High-Value Driver)
**Trigger**: Dashboard view for engaged users (3+ check-ins)
**Message**: "Get AI suggestions for your partner based on your journal insights"
**CTA**: "Start Premium Trial"
**Psychology**: Appeals to relationship improvement motivation

#### 3. Relationship Limit (Growth Driver)
**Trigger**: Attempting to add 6th relationship
**Message**: "Premium users can track unlimited relationships"
**Psychology**: Targets power users already invested in the platform

### Conversion Flow Design

#### Gentle Onramp (Non-Aggressive)
1. **First Week**: No premium prompts, focus on habit formation
2. **Week 2-3**: Soft premium feature highlights in UI
3. **Week 4+**: Active conversion prompts at natural friction points

#### Value-First Approach
- Show premium features in context of actual use
- Demonstrate concrete value before asking for payment
- Use social proof and success stories

### Paywall UI Components âœ…

#### Modal Design
```typescript
<PaywallModal 
  feature="partner_suggestions"
  title="Unlock Partner Suggestions"
  description="Get personalized AI suggestions delivered to your partner daily"
  ctaText="Start Premium Trial"
/>
```

#### Locked Feature States
