## üß† RESEARCH FOUNDATION (Critical Context)

### **FIRO Theory Integration**:
- **Inclusion Need**: How much user needs to feel included/connected (1-9 scale)
- **Control Need**: How much user needs influence/structure (1-9 scale)  
- **Affection Need**: How much user needs closeness/intimacy (1-9 scale)
- **Current User Example**: inclusion:8/control:7/affection:8 (high needs across all areas)

### **Attachment Theory Integration**:
- **Secure**: Comfortable with intimacy and independence
- **Anxious**: Craves closeness, fears abandonment
- **Avoidant**: Values independence, uncomfortable with closeness
- **Disorganized**: Inconsistent patterns, internal conflict
- **Current User Example**: disorganized attachment style

### **Communication Style Integration**:
- **Directness**: direct vs diplomatic vs indirect
- **Assertiveness**: assertive vs passive vs aggressive
- **Current User Example**: direct + assertive communication

### **Relationship Type Psychology** (Phase 3 Core):
| Type | AI Tone | Emotional Intensity | Nudging Frequency | Boundaries |
|------|---------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Romantic | Emotionally warm, intimate | High | Moderate | Intimacy appropriate |
| Family | Affirming but diplomatically firm | Medium | Gentle | Respect family roles |
| Friend | Casual, supportive, encouraging | Medium | Infrequent | Maintain independence |
| Work | Respectful, professional, neutral | Low | Low | Professional boundaries essential |
| Other | Balanced, adaptive approach | Medium | Moderate | Context-appropriate |

## üìä CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS (What's Working vs What Needs Building)

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING PERFECTLY (Don't Break These):

**Database Architecture**:
- `universal_user_profiles` - FIRO needs, attachment styles, communication preferences ‚úÖ
- `relationship_profiles` - relationship-specific context (closeness, frequency, interaction preferences) ‚úÖ

- `journal_entries` - with relationship_id for context ‚úÖ
- `enhanced_journal_analysis` - psychological analysis of journal content ‚úÖ
- `insights` - personal insights for journal writer ‚úÖ
- `partner_suggestions` - suggestions for partners (correctly excludes journal writer) ‚úÖ

**AI Systems Working**:
- **Unified Journal System**: `/api/journal/unified-save-and-analyze` endpoint ‚úÖ
- **Personal Insights**: Generate 4 insights with warm friend tone for journal writer ‚úÖ
- **Partner Suggestions**: Generate 3 suggestions with warm friend tone for partner only ‚úÖ
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Psychological analysis with research-backed data ‚úÖ
- **Grok AI Integration**: Working API calls to Grok-4 model ‚úÖ

**User Experience Working**:

## üî¨ RESEARCH-BACKED PSYCHOLOGY FOUNDATION

### **FIRO Theory (Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation)**:
- **Inclusion**: Need for connection and belonging (affects how AI emphasizes social aspects)
- **Control**: Need for influence and structure (affects how AI offers agency vs guidance)
- **Affection**: Need for closeness and warmth (affects AI emotional intensity)

### **Attachment Theory Integration**:
- **Secure**: AI can be direct and confident
- **Anxious**: AI provides extra reassurance and validation
- **Avoidant**: AI respects independence and doesn't push closeness
- **Disorganized**: AI is gentle about relationship struggles, validates internal conflict

### **Communication Style Theory**:
- **Direct + Assertive**: AI uses straightforward language, honest feedback
- **Indirect + Diplomatic**: AI uses gentle suggestions, softer approaches
- **Passive**: AI provides structure and encouragement to speak up

### **Relationship Type Psychology** (Thomas-Kilmann + Interpersonal Communication Research):
Each relationship type has different expectations, boundaries, and communication norms that AI must respect.

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOR CLAUDE CODE

### **Phase 3 Step-by-Step Approach**:

1. **Start Simple**: Build relationship-type config system first
2. **Test One Type**: Implement romantic relationship support, test thoroughly
3. **Add Incrementally**: Add family, then friend, then work, then other
4. **Integrate APIs**: Modify existing working APIs to use relationship-type awareness
5. **Add Context Switching**: Build multi-relationship support
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Validate all relationship types and user scenarios

### **Key Principles**:
- **Preserve Working Features**: Don't break the warm AI personality or unified journal system
- **Build Incrementally**: One relationship type at a time
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify each type works before adding next
- **Maintain Research Foundation**: Keep FIRO + Attachment + Communication integration
- **Respect Boundaries**: Ensure appropriate suggestions for each relationship type

### **Quality Assurance**:
- Romantic relationships should get emotionally warm, intimate AI responses
- Work relationships should get professional, boundaried AI responses
- Family relationships should get diplomatically supportive AI responses
- Friend relationships should get casual, positive AI responses
- Multi-relationship users should get proper context switching
- No inappropriate suggestions (e.g., no intimacy suggestions for work relationships)
